# Steepest-gradient-descent
This project was realised for the introduction to topology in science research module LU1SXARE at Sorbonne Universit√©. It consists in a program that calculates gaussian values, shown on a dot grid, with a step of 0.1, find the max value of the gird, and to find the max basin of the gaussians.  
## How does it work?
In order to understand how our program works, we invite you to read the user manual pdf document and the lesson sheet pdf document
## Compilation
To compile, write in a terminal:
```
python3 Programme_Gaussienne.py
```
You will see an example of gaussians that we made in a window that will pop out after the compilation.
If you want to see you own gaussians, write in a terminal:
```
python3 Programme_Gaussienne_extremas.py
```
We would like to precise that ou program can show up to 5 gaussians.
